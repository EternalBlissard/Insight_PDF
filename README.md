# Insight PDF

A powerful PDF reading and question-answering application that helps users interact with large PDF documents effectively.

## Problem Statement

PDF documents, especially large ones, present significant challenges for information retrieval and analysis. Current limitations include:

- Traditional search methods often miss contextual relevance
- Large PDFs are difficult to navigate and analyze quickly
- LLMs struggle with memory limitations when processing entire documents
- Users typically need multiple tools: one for viewing PDFs and another for asking questions about them

## Solution

Insight PDF provides an integrated platform that solves these challenges by combining advanced document processing with intelligent question answering:

- Processes PDFs using chunking and embedding techniques to make documents queryable
- Creates a vector database of document content for semantic retrieval
- Provides a built-in PDF viewer alongside the question-answering interface
- Employs AI to generate accurate, contextual responses to user queries
